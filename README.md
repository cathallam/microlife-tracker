## Microlife Calculator :hourglass:

We all know that when we exercise we live longer, and when we go to McDonald's for dinner we die sooner. Well fortunately this can now be equated as a microlife. 1 ML (microlife) is equivalent to 30 minutes of your life. You therefore lose 48 MLs of your life everyday. But that isn't all - the decisions we make in the day have the ability add to those MLs (decrease life expectancy) or to subtract from those MLs (increase life expectancy).

|      |                             |
|------|-----------------------------|
| -1   | Each 5kg you are overweight |
| -1   | 85g red meat                |
| -1   | Two hours of TV             |
| -0.5 | Smoking a cigarette         |
| -0.5 | A pint of beer              |
| +1   | 2-3 cups of coffee          |
| +2   | 22 minute walk              |

This therefore means that if I pop to the pub for a pint after today's class, and then walk 22 minutes to McDonald's for a burger, then my total MLs for the day will be 47.5 so I will have gained 30 minutes of life expectancy (woohoo :hamburger: :beer:)

Disclaimer: Although there is some science behind this, the project is just intended for fun and we can't guarantee the data to be accurate (please don't sue us).

We will be building a life activity tracker, which will tell us how much our life expectancy has increased or decreased based on a day's activities. The structure will be similar to that of last week's application, but this week we will just use a single JSON file to store information about the user and their activities.

This week's application will be developed with a Test-Driven approach.
